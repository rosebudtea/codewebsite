      <p>Hello! My name is Jessa!</p>
      <p>
        I'm a 26 year-old Software Engineer with 4 years industry experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily work on the back-end (the stage hand of the programming
        world) but I've also had front-end experience getting all the buttons
        working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Front-end or back-end I love seeing the gears start to turn and tests
        start to pass. While I'm primarily a java programmer I've dabbled in
        multiple different languages, including C, C#, Python, and
        Javascript/Typescript, and I see no reason to stop learning now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working on web apps but I try not to limit myself. My dream
        project would probably be a custom writing application for me to keep
        all my notes just how I like them (gotta keep things organized). I have
        also started poking around in game development with Unity and I think
        that could be pretty fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is mostly for me to upload any projects that I work on, either
        in demos or in devlogs. Feel free to look around!
